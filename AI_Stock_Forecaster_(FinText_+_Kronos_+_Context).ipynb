    "## 0) Project Explanation & Philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "### What this project is\n",
    "\n",
    "This project builds a **decision-support forecasting model** that answers one core question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Which AI stocks are most attractive to buy today, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 20 / 60 / 90 trading days?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The system outputs **ranked stock recommendations and return distributions**, not trades.  \n",
    "Its purpose is to generate **credible alpha signals** that survive realistic financial constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design explicitly accounts for:\n",
    "- non-stationary market behavior,\n",
    "- weak and noisy financial signals,\n",
    "- transaction costs and liquidity effects,\n",
    "- and strict point-in-time (PIT) correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What this project is NOT\n",
    "\n",
    "This project does **not**:\n",
    "- place trades,\n",
    "- connect to brokers,\n",
    "- optimize execution,\n",
    "- or manage live capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any portfolio-related logic exists **only to validate signal realism**, not to implement trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core modeling philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ranking beats regression**  \n",
    "   Relative ordering of stocks is more stable and economically useful than exact price prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Point-in-time correctness is non-negotiable**  \n",
    "   Any signal unavailable at time *T* must not influence predictions at time *T*.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Economic validity > statistical fit**  \n",
    "   Signals must survive transaction costs, turnover, and regime shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multiple weak signals > single strong model**  \n",
    "   Combine complementary views:\n",
    "   - price dynamics (Kronos),\n",
    "   - return structure (FinText-TSFM),\n",
    "   - fundamentals and context (tabular models).\n",

    "### Scope\n",
    "- The system produces **signals**, not trades.\n",
    "- No execution or order placement logic is implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why portfolio concepts still appear\n",
    "Portfolio concepts (turnover, costs, constraints) are used **only for evaluation realism**, to answer:\n",
    "> *Would these signals remain economically meaningful if followed by an investor?*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional realism check\n",
    "- Paper trading (e.g., Alpaca paper) may be used **post-hoc** to validate:\n",
    "  - timestamp integrity,\n",
    "  - universe construction,\n",
    "  - signal stability.\n",
