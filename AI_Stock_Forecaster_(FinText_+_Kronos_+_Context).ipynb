        "\n",
        "This project builds a **decision-support forecasting model** that answers one core question:\n",

        "> **Which AI stocks are most attractive to buy today, on a risk-adjusted basis, over the next 20 / 60 / 90 trading days?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The system outputs **ranked stock recommendations and return distributions**, not trades.  \n",
        "Its purpose is to generate **credible alpha signals** that survive realistic financial constraints.\n",

        "The design explicitly accounts for:\n",
        "- non-stationary market behavior,\n",
        "- weak and noisy financial signals,\n",
        "- transaction costs and liquidity effects,\n",
